/**
 * Mutex server connector for client.
 *
 * The {@link MutexConnector} is a communicator class who can connect to a remote `mutex-server`
 * and interact with it through websocket and [RFC](https://github.com/samchon/tgrid#13-remote-function-call)
 * protocol.
 *
 * You can connect to the websocket `mutex-server` using {@link connect} method. After the
 * connection, get network level remote critical section components using one of below methods.
 * After utilizing those components, please do not forget to realising the component by calling
 * {@link IRemoteComponent.destructor} or closing connection with the `mutex-server` by calling
 * the {@link close} method to prevent waste of resources of the `mutex-server`.
 *
 *   - Solid Components
 *     - {@link getConditionVariable}
 *     - {@link getMutex}
 *     - {@link getSemaphore}
 *   - Adaptor Comopnents
 *     - {@link getBarrier}
 *     - {@link getLatch}
 *
 * Also, when declaring this {@link MutexConnector} type, you've to define two template arguments,
 * *Header* and *Provider*. The *Header* type repersents an initial data sending to the remote
 * `mutex-server` after connection. I hope you not to omit it and utilize it as an activation tool
 * to enhance security.
 *
 * The second template argument *Provider* represents the custom features provided for the remote
 * `mutex-server`. If you don't have any plan to provide any feature to the `mutex-server`, just
 * declare it as `null`.
 *
 * @template Header Type of the *header* containing initial data.
 * @template Provider Type of additional features provided for the remote server. If no plan to provide anything, declare `null`.
